# quick-resize
Python script to crop and resize an image or batch of images to a desired aspect ratio and/or resolution

For now, you'll need Python 3.x installed to run this tool. Only the **desResolution** and **keepResolution** variables need to be adjusted by the user.

**desResolution** - The desired image resolution

**keepResolution** - Set to 'False' if you want to resize the image to the originally desired resolution; set to 'True' to keep the new resolution

Place images in the **Photos** folder. Currently only support for JPEG files.
